# HardwareWordle

As part of a 5-hour-long hardware competition hosted by [Pulse](https://pulse.ece.illinois.edu/), my group and I decided to make a hardware version of the puzzle game [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) by utilizing an Arduino, 12 shift registers.

The .ino file included contains code for
a) the main mechanic of the game that determines which letters are correct, correct but misplaced, and incorrect
b) generating a clock for 6 clock cycles for a specific register based on the guess number

Unfortunately, we weren't successful, but it was still quite fun, especially for me, since I learned a lot about Arduino IDE (and teamwork of course!) along the way.
